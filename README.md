# Dynamic Variables — Burp Suite Extension

> **Placeholder-based request variables for Repeater, Intruder, Scanner and Proxy with transparent auto-refreshing on session expiration (401/403) in Burp Suite.**

Dynamic Variables is a Burp Suite extension that brings template variables and automatic session refreshes to your pentesting workflow. Define placeholders like `{{token}}` in Repeater, Intruder, Scanner, or Proxy requests (similar to how it is done in Postman), optionally require a custom tag such as `{{dv:token}}` to avoid collisions with security payloads, select text in HTTP responses to auto-generate regex extraction rules, and repeat login/refresh requests automatically in the background when your session expires.

## Features

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Placeholder Substitution** | Scans outgoing requests in **Repeater**, **Intruder**, **Scanner**, and **Proxy** for active placeholder templates and replaces them with their actual values in real-time. |
| 2 | **Regex Auto-Deduction** | Highlight any token (JWT, cookie, JWE, anti-CSRF) in a response, right-click, and select *Assign to Variable...*. The scanner auto-generates the matching regex for JSON keys, query params, or XML tags. |
| 3 | **Variables Dashboard** | A centralized tab in Burp Suite to manage variable values, auto-extraction rules, and background request execution. Includes independent toggles to enable/disable substitution in Repeater, Intruder, Scanner, and Proxy. |
| 4 | **Request Auto-Refreshing** | Saves the request template that generated your token (e.g., login or auth endpoint). Re-sends it instantly in a background thread from the tab to fetch a fresh token. |
| 5 | **Recursive Injection** | If your saved refresh request itself depends on other variables (like credentials or client keys), they are substituted automatically before launching the request. |
| 6 | **Transparent Session Recovery** | When a request containing variables receives an HTTP `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response, the extension automatically pauses the transaction, executes the refresh request, updates the variable, and re-sends the original request with the fresh token. |
| 7 | **Interactive Rule Editor** | Click *Update Rule from Response...* to run the saved request and highlight the new token value directly in a raw HTTP response editor to auto-update the regex rule. |
| 8 | **Repeater Integration** | Send your saved login/refresh requests directly to the Repeater tab for manual tweaking and testing. |
| 9 | **Request Editor Sub-Tab** | Adds a custom request editor tab next to Raw/Hex to display a sidebar listing all defined variables. Double-click any variable to insert a placeholder using the active syntax. |
| 10 | **Zero Dependencies** | Built using the native Montoya API. No external libraries, 100% self-contained JAR. |
| 11 | **Variable Folders** | Organize variables by user, session, or context. Folder variables use qualified placeholders such as `{{alice.token}}`, allowing `alice.token` and `bob.token` to coexist safely. |
| 12 | **Request Folder Switching** | Replace every matching placeholder from one folder with its counterpart in another folder directly from a request's context menu. |
| 13 | **Materialize Repeater Variables** | Preview and permanently replace all known placeholders in an editable Repeater request with their current text values for direct testing without variables. |
| 14 | **Configurable Placeholder Tag** | Optionally require a custom tag such as `dv` so only `{{dv:variable_name}}` is substituted and unrelated `{{...}}` pentesting payloads remain untouched. |

## How to Use

### 1. Define a Variable Manually
1. Open the **Variables** tab in Burp Suite.
2. Optionally click **New Folder** and create a folder such as `alice`.
3. Select the folder and click **New Variable**, or create the variable in **Ungrouped**.
4. Enter a name (e.g., `api_key` or `token`). Folder and variable names cannot contain `.`.
5. Select the variable in the table, and paste the value in the **Variable Value Editor** on the right.
6. In Repeater, reference an ungrouped variable as `{{api_key}}` or a grouped variable as `{{alice.token}}`. It will be substituted when the request is sent.

Folders can be expanded or collapsed. Drag variables to reorder them or move them between folders; because moving changes the placeholder, the extension shows the old and new placeholders before applying the move. Right-click a variable to rename it, copy its placeholder, move it, or delete it.

#### Optional: Require a Placeholder Tag

The default syntax remains `{{token}}`, preserving existing projects. To distinguish extension variables from SSTI or other payloads:

1. Click **Configuration...** in the Dynamic Variables tab.
2. Enable **Use a tag in variable placeholders**.
3. Enter a tag such as `dv` or `pentest` and review the example.
4. Save the configuration.

With the tag `dv`, use `{{dv:token}}` or `{{dv:alice.token}}`. Only placeholders with that exact, case-sensitive tag are substituted; `{{token}}`, `{{7*7}}`, and placeholders using another tag are transmitted unchanged. Existing requests are not rewritten automatically. Copying or inserting a variable uses the currently active syntax.

### 2. Auto-Extract Variables from Responses
1. Send a request that returns a token in the response (e.g., login request).
2. Go to the **Response** viewer tab.
3. Highlight the token value inside the response body or headers.
4. Right-click the highlighted text and click **Assign to Variable...**.
5. Choose **Ungrouped** or a folder, then select or type a variable name. The **Regex Pattern** is automatically generated for you.
6. Make sure **"Save this request to refresh token in the future"** is checked.
7. Click **Save Rule**.

### 3. Using the Dynamic Variables Request Tab
1. Open the **Repeater** tab.
2. Under the **Request** viewer panel (where you see *Raw*, *Pretty*, *Hex*), click the **"Dynamic Variables"** tab.
3. You will see:
   - On the left: a list of your variables (e.g. `jwt`, `session_id`).
   - On the right: the raw HTTP request text.
4. Position your cursor in the HTTP request text (e.g., next to `Authorization: Bearer `).
5. **Double-click** the variable `jwt` in the left list (or select it and click **Insert**).
6. The placeholder `{{jwt}}` will be immediately inserted at the cursor position.
7. Click **Send** to transmit the request.

### 4. Switching a Request to Another Variable Folder
1. Open a request containing grouped placeholders, for example `{{user1.jwe}}` and `{{user1.accountId}}`.
2. Right-click anywhere in the request and choose **Cambiar carpeta de variables…**.
3. Select `user1` as the source folder and `user2` as the target folder.
4. Review the preview and click **Aplicar cambio**.

Only variables with the same local name in the target folder are changed. For example, if `user2` contains both `jwe` and `accountId`, the request becomes `{{user2.jwe}}` and `{{user2.accountId}}`. A source placeholder without a counterpart in `user2` remains unchanged and is listed in the preview.

#### Using Folders to Test Different Users

Folders are especially useful for representing different authenticated users, roles, or tenants during authorization testing. Create one folder per identity and give equivalent variables the same local names.

For example, the `user1` and `user2` folders can both contain `jwe` and `accountId`. Build the request once using:

`{{user1.jwe}}` and `{{user1.accountId}}`

Then use **Cambiar carpeta de variables…** from the request context menu to switch it to:

`{{user2.jwe}}` and `{{user2.accountId}}`

Only placeholders with a matching variable in the target folder are changed. Placeholders without a counterpart remain untouched and are shown in the preview.

This makes it quick and less error-prone to repeat the same request as another user when testing horizontal or vertical authorization, IDOR/BOLA vulnerabilities, role separation, and multi-tenant isolation.

### 5. Materializing Variables in a Repeater Request
1. Open an editable Repeater request containing placeholders such as `{{token}}` or `{{alice.accountId}}`.
2. Right-click anywhere in the request and choose **Sustituir variables por sus valores…**.
3. Review the current values that will be inserted and any unknown placeholders that will remain unchanged.
4. Click **Sustituir valores** to update the request's path, header values, and body.

This modifies the template currently open in Repeater. Once a placeholder has been replaced with text, later updates to that variable no longer affect this request. Duplicate the Repeater tab first or use Repeater's undo support if you may need the original template again.

### 6. Transparent 401/403 Session Recovery
1. Use a placeholder variable (e.g. `{{jwt}}`) in any Repeater, Intruder, or Scanner request.
2. If the session expires and the server returns an HTTP 401 or 403 status:
   - The extension intercepts the response before it is displayed.
   - It executes the saved login request synchronously, updates the `jwt` variable value, and re-injects the new token.
   - It re-sends the request to the target server and displays the successful response transparently.
3. You do not need to manually copy-paste or click anything; the request heals itself.

### 7. Interactive Rule Updating
1. If the API response structure changes, select your variable in the table.
2. Click **Update Rule from Response...**.
3. The plugin fetches a fresh response from the server and displays it in a raw viewer.
4. Highlight the new token location in this viewer to immediately regenerate the regex pattern.
5. Click **Save Extraction Rule** to save changes.

## Use Cases for Pentesters

| Scenario | How it helps |
|----------|--------------|
| **JWT/JWE Rotation** | Set up a regex extraction rule on the login endpoint response. The JWT variable updates dynamically whenever you send a login or authenticate request, updating all active Repeater templates. |
| **Session Cookie Refresh** | Extract cookie headers (`Set-Cookie: session=([^;]+)`) and replace them in all target Repeater tabs using `Cookie: session={{session_cookie}}`. |
| **Active Scanning & Fuzzing** | Run Intruder or Scanner audits using `{{token}}`. Since these tools support the toggles, when the token expires in the middle of a scan, the plugin auto-heals the session and continues the audit seamlessly. |
| **Credential Management** | Store your testing passwords or administrative user logins as variables, and change them once globally to update all your fuzzing/repeating setups. |

## Installation

### Requirements
- **Java**: JDK 17 or later
- **Burp Suite**: Any edition compatible with Montoya API (2023.12+)

### Build from Source

The project uses Gradle to produce a clean, lightweight JAR file:

```bash
gradle build
```

The output JAR will be created at:
```
build/libs/dynamic-variables-1.0.1.jar
```

### Load in Burp Suite

1. Open Burp Suite.
2. Go to **Extensions** → **Installed**.
3. Click **Add**.
4. Set **Extension type** to `Java`.
5. Select the compiled `dynamic-variables-1.0.1.jar` file and click **Next**.

## Running the Test Suite

Run the commands from the repository root. The suite uses JUnit 5 and covers placeholder parsing, tagged and untagged substitution, request rewriting, folder remapping, preference persistence, and state migration.

On macOS or Linux, the most reliable command is:

```bash
java -classpath gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain test
```

On Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
java -classpath gradle\wrapper\gradle-wrapper.jar org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain test
```

The standard Gradle wrapper commands can also be used:

```bash
./gradlew test        # macOS/Linux
```

```powershell
gradlew.bat test      # Windows
```

If `./gradlew` reports a classpath or `sed` error when the repository path contains spaces, use the direct `java -classpath ...` command shown above.

To force every test to run again without reusing Gradle task results:

```bash
java -classpath gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain test --rerun-tasks
```

To run the suite and produce the extension JAR in one invocation:

```bash
java -classpath gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain test jar
```

A successful run ends with `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`. Gradle writes the browsable report to `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` and the machine-readable JUnit XML results to `build/test-results/test/`.
